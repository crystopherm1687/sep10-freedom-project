|Benson|I like that the website is very functional with the automatic carocel.|I think that what you should improve on is the positioning of the carocel and making the aframe design more extended horizonatlly.
| Edward  | I really like your volleyball simulation in aframe. I also like how you add it so that the text changes after clicking one of the tabs in the intro/conetxt/overview. I like how you made the heading words in the color scheme of a volleyball. | I think picking a more constant color scheme would make it look better because it seems like the color scheme is all over the place.
| Alialrida  |  I like how the navbar would include the pargarphs under each title and I also like how the world volley ball has three different colors. |I think however the volleyball holigrapch screen is too narrow and needs more widening with it going along with website when it strecthes.
