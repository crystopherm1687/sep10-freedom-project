# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Starting with a fact about volleyball like how popular it is or what it does.

## Product
* As i'm talking i will refer to more than just the website and add on/explain the meaning of some elements and or topic that i made the website about. Using my body language to get an interested audience. More like guiding them through how it actually works.

## Process
* Plan
 * MVP: Elaborate from the slides. -> introduce aframe code
 * beyond MVP: explain what went on with the coding process.

## Conclusion
* I will quickly summarize what was said or explain more of the website then say thank you for your time.
* Show URL
* Take away's
 * If something does not work don't be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes a conversation can go a long way.
 * Plan ahead with your time. Sometimes you have hobbies or events to go to that take time needed to complete assignments. Use your time wisely.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
