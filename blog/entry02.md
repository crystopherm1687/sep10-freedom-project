What you found: the info you have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies you found in your topic. Go into detail! 
<p>Ever since blog 1 as my research slowly goes well the information I have to been to discover is truly interesting as if you are going through a new experience which can help me develop my ideas for technology use in volleyball. This website 
 <a href="https://volleystation.com/"volleystation> has tools that coaches and referees can use during games to review them. They are the Official partner for the polish volleyball league and federation meaning people have access worldwide and multiple universities in the US use the website and trust them. Another fascinating page I uncovered was this 
   <a href="https://www.sportsvideo.org/2023/05/08/italian-womens-professional-volleyball-league-broadcast-powered-by-blackmagic-design/" alt="volleyball article"</a> where the hardware they use is the Blackmagic Video Assist 7” 12G HDR for monitoring and recording.
They also have AMS crews that use the vectorscope and histogram to test and monitor signal pathways for cameras when setting up allowing them toreview footage to determine plays and stream online to different websites. Not only is there technology to help with matches but there is hardware and software made by <a href="https://kinexon-sports.com/products/perform-imu/"kinexon sports</a> showing accurate processing of data from games and live analysis as well as tracking of players anywhere. This type of hardware is able to fit in your pocket and light, while it also includes a sensor for its benefits.
