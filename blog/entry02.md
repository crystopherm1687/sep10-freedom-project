What you found: the info you have gathered regarding the software + hardware technologies you found in your topic. Go into detail! 
<p>Ever since blog 1 as my research slowly goes well the information I have to been to discover is truly interesting as if you are going through a new experience which can help me develop my ideas for technology use in volleyball. This website 
 <a href="https://volleystation.com/">volleystation</a> has tools that coaches and referees can use during games to review them. They are the Official partner for the polish volleyball league and federation meaning people have access worldwide and multiple universities in the US use the website and trust them. Another great page I uncovered was this volleyball article about
   <a href="https://www.sportsvideo.org/2023/05/08/italian-womens-professional-volleyball-league-broadcast-powered-by-blackmagic-design/">Italian Women’s Professional Volleyball League Broadcast Powered by Blackmagic Design</a>by SVG staff. Here the hardware they use is the Blackmagic Video Assist 7” 12G HDR used for monitoring and recording.
They also have AMS crews that use the vectorscope and histogram to test and monitor signal pathways for cameras when setting up allowing them toreview footage to determine plays and stream online to different websites. Not only is there technology to help with matches but there is hardware and software made by <a href="https://kinexon-sports.com/products/perform-imu/">kinexon sports</a> showing accurate processing of data from games and live analysis as well as tracking of players anywhere. This type of hardware is able to fit in your pocket and light, while it also includes a sensor to form data.

<p>Since I was researching specific aspects of technology some of the first google searches were What hardware and software exists in **volleyball**? leading me to some websites, apps or articles but I was looking more for websites and apps that had been developed to help create or review information just from playing **volleyball**. Although some apps were great I found most of them to not be helpful so i switched to the image tab of google and from there mutiple sources of infomation, pictures and different websites were present. Other search results included what technology do professional **volleyball** games use and what apps have been produced for volleyball. One of these results led me to an article about camera equipemnt with screens like they going to film a movie but with a smaller set up so it wouldn't interfere with the game itself. All of this technology developed makes some wonder how we are able to use this equipment but there is a whole lot information you will need to understand in my Engineering design process explantion.

<!-- 1 paragraph is fine-->
The Engineering design process as some call it is a method used to develop innovations, products, objects or techonlogy that can be applied in certain parts of our lives. Some examples include your phone, computer, desk, home, door, cameras, clocks, tv's, and so much more. This process can be broken down into mutiple steps and as for me I am currently on step 2 which is researching my topic and so far i feel comfortable with the amount of techonlogy explored in the field of **volleyball**. Considering how big of an impact technology has on the world it is important to understand how it works so i can later use or implement it in the future. 



<h2>Skills</h2>
<h3>Googling Information</h3>
<p>Because I spent a lot of time researching about **volleyball** my skill of googling really helped me to develop different ways to search infomation on the internet. For example when I was attempting to find intriguing websites there just wasn't any so I went to google images and there were more sources to be found that could be used for my project. Another example included the use of keywords like apps, websites or technology allowing an expansion of infomative websites. Finding mutiple sources for volleyball made it seem like a challenge but after nagivating for a bit it became manageable and a good experience. </p>

<h3>Reading Specific words</h3>
<p> During my time finding some infomation I found out that some terms on certain articles were confusing so I decided to google their meanings and inspected the vocab. Some of these terms included AMS, streamlining, meticulously and seamless which were hard to identify their significance at first. After googling their meanings as part of my first skill it was thrilling to gain some knowledge of differnt words because I can use them and the websites along with the articles made more sense. Since knowing information was part of my project remembering the words could work out for me as it expands my choice of words to get people in my topic.</p>

<h3>summary</h3>
<p>Since we are almost done with researching parts of our project it would mean we are near the next stage of the engineering design process and i feel prepared to encounter new challenges to develop my project into a very good topic.</p>
