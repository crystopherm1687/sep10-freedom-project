## Content

In my topic of Volleyball specifically part B, an invention I was thinking about making was a volleyball holographic stats screen along with some goggles. Basically my idea was to have all types of information available to everyone right away so that people could be aware of the game and know what points were scored by which team. I wanted something that could be useable by everyone but not physical which i was intending to make these screens appear. Since this information is important for the coaches they be more efficent and save time doing extra work adding statistics to their teams. Here I found a solution to a small problem that can be easily fixed but i was also thinking if you could modify these holographic screens so that not just normal people use it but the blind and deaf too so they enjoy an exciting experience.

For my freedom project content i organized it into categories of use that i determined because i know some tools are better than others. Since i know information i obtained had to be changed to my own words i summarized the websites as a way to let others know what they going to visit if they were curious about my websites. Also organzing the information with their respective links made it easier to understand what i had researched.

## EDP

In the progress of the Engineering design process I have begun to develop a solution for a problem and thought about ways to help people in the area of volleyball for the future. Basically i am developing ideas for a design for a screen that has everything and is accessible anywhere which would help people a lot since some people have problems like eye vision or a disability. Of course it is not my only idea but i will need a backup plan in case my idea doesnt work out as intended. Also while going across these solutions someone told me about adding goggles to the players so it could be easier to visualize their movements and perspective from the audience. With this creative view on my invention i could probably improve some things so as to give people a better experience with easy to understand details.

## Skills 

Some of the skills I used was organzing myself and manging my time effectively. in terms of organzing it mean that i'm taking the time to fix things like ny notes or put my work in the correct folders so that looking for worksheets isn't such a hard time and i lose nothing important that i need for class. For my notes i found myself putting them in a unique way for my own understanding and give others a simple idea as to what i'm talking about.

As for manging my time i made sure to finish my work on time as teachers push due dates and it becomes overwhelming but once you get the hang of it you find youself doing task easier and it just becomes a simple thing. Since it takes less time to do work i find myself doing other assignments that i can complete and everything ties in well to my school life.
