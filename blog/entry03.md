In my topic of Volleyball specifically part B, an invention I was thinking about making was a volleyball holographic stats screen along with some goggles. Basically my idea was to have all types of information available to everyone right away so that people could be aware of the game and know what points were scored by which team. I wanted something that could be useable by everyone but not physical which i was intending to make these screens appear. Since this information is important for the coaches they be more efficent and save time doing extra work adding statistics to their teams. Here I found a solution to a small problem that can be easily fixed but i was also thinking if you could modify these holographic screens so that not just normal people use it but the blind and deaf too so they enjoy an exciting experience.

For my freedom project content i organized it into categories of use that i determined because i know some tools are better than others. Since i know information i obtained had to be changed to my own words i summarized the websites as a way to let others know what they going to visit if they were curious about my websites. Also organzing the information with their respective links made it easier to understand what i had researched.
