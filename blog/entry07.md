##### 5/5/25

## Context
Throughout the entire year of SEP there was always an interesting topic to focus on whether it was a small coding project or collboration between members for a grade. The one project that was always on our minds was the Freedom projetc we had worked on for the entire year every monday for what seemed like a long time. Despite the efforts the class did it felt stressful to work on a project that didn't seem in our reach. After quite some debate we found ourselves getting better with coding skills while we had to reseacrh information and study tools for the project. Considering the amount of work we put in, everyone seemed excited over the day we would present our topics and showcase a new development of coders and ideas to the school. It felt rought at times since the due date was always on our minds and if we could actually pull of a great project that required creativity. As time passed it didn't seem like the project was really hard and everyone had great insipiration for making their topics. 

### Takeaways for EXPO

Some of the takeaways that could be applied for later expo's would be better expressing yourself to others as they find out what topic you have been doing. Furthermore being confident and knowing what to say in advance would help you in deciding what a good or bad project is like. With this experience, imrpovements in website design and overall product are important for my project because it didn't feel like a proper presentation and people somewhat got an idea of how volleyball could be changed. Overall the idea or presenting to people makes it hard for me to do something but after this expo I'm feeling more ready to do things that i normally wouldn't do.

### Takeaways for class presentation

To better prepare myself for the class presentations on our topics my biggest advances would have to be making slides that demonstrate the process of my website and use of tool as it would make my slide presentation more interesting. Another big advance that has to happen is the way I speak because it didn't really feel like i was actually paying attention to the audience as they looked in my direction. Additionally as i work on future slides i have to make sure the information is in the right place and add in some background information just in case people want to know more. Lastly even as i wait for my turn i have to expect the unexpected and be ready for presenting as people wait to hear each other's ideas which could be important later.

## EDP
The final step of the Engineering design process which is communicating the solution like the in class presentations and expo showcase really got me to step out of my comfort zone and explain to everyone interested what my topic and website would do for them. On top of that i got to learn first hand how difficult some things are to do with coding and research for your topic which got me exploring in different places. Trying to present my ideas to people was a first for me and now that I know what needs to improve the suggestions i got will be on my mind and I will try my best next year to focus on creating a better project.

## Skills

#### Public speaking

During our in class presentations and expo showcase it felt really nerve-racking to say what my project was about to my classmates and upperclassmen. Once i got up to present everyone's eyes were up at me and i had to follow the flow of my slides and elevator pitch to stay focused within the time limit. My voice didn't feel confident or very loud but i persisted with my talk and gave evryone who listened an overview of what I was trying to do with volleyball through the website and informative slides. Once I was done it felt the worse was over but the grade i got was not what i expected but there is improvement for me to do so now the idea for my topic has to be very presentable with all the required information ready like a better pitch and slides.

#### Planning Ahead

In the time that the class was focused on making their projects i felt like going fast to try make my project stand out but I soon realized that things were not going to go the way they were supposed to go. This was because my schedule for school, home and athletic life were all on top of each other and the responisbility I had to bear was very hard but I somehow managed to get through it by staying up late and doing assignments fast. The thing i didn't really have time for anything and so I want to make a specific time line for events that have to be done or are upcoming so I'm better prepared for them. Although it may have flaws like invitations to parties or unplanned sleeping breaks I will try my best to remind myself through notifications at set days to get myself working.
