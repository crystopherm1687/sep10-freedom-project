## EDP
Going through all the steps of the engineering design process has been hard even as I'm finishing up the website because thinking and revising my work has taken longer than expected to complete because of all the things i have to do for other classes and daily life.

## Skills

### Time management
When I'm coding, time management is crucial to staying productive and avoiding burnout. I start by breaking down the project into smaller tasks and setting realistic deadlines for each one. I use a timer to focus during work sessions and take short breaks in between to stay sharp. Prioritizing bugs or features that need immediate attention helps me stay on track, and I make sure to review my progress at the end of each day to adjust my plan if needed. This routine keeps me organized and helps me write cleaner, more efficient code.

### patience 
As I code the website, patience is one of the most important skills I rely on. Sometimes things don’t work the way I expect, and it’s easy to get frustrated when a bug takes hours to fix. Instead of rushing, I remind myself to slow down, read error messages carefully, and try different solutions methodically. I’ve learned that taking a short break can help clear my mind and give me a fresh perspective. Staying patient not only helps me solve problems more effectively but also makes the whole coding process more enjoyable.
