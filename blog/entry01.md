<h1>choosing a topic(volleyball)</h1>

<p>The topic i am choosing for this project is volleyball because it is one of my favorite sports to play after watching an anime called Haikyuu and watching videos online of professional people playing the sport. My passion of the sport from watching my school team play and learning with them also influenced me to join the team and try something new. Although i was considereing other topics such as Architecture or business they didn't seem like something i would in interested in for long and so i am focusing more on volleyball. From my time researching volleyball I was curiuos about some history and found some interesting facts on <a href="https://thefactfile.org/volleyball-facts/">Factfile.</a> Of course I had to think about the smaller details such as play requierements and interest in the sport but what really got me going was <a href="https://usavolleyball.org/play/the-benefits-of-volleyball/"></a>The Benefits of Volleyball. This really gave me another 10 reasons to choose Volleyball as while i was watching professional volleyball I found it interesting for them to also use technology to decide whether certain plays had to be called or not(In or out, block touch, player touching net, and so on.)</p> 

<h2>EDP</h2>
<p>In this project I am in the second step which will help me progress much faster with reaserch because I hope to inform multiply people about the facts and rules abou the game so they could understand games better and maybe start playing as a hobby where they can enjoy it with friends. For my next step I am already planning a few ways to present my ideas but i had to fully think about them so they would make sense and people can review them professionally.</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Some of the skills I managed to gain was planning out my next steps and time management.</p>

<h4>Planning out my next steps</h4>
<p>while I am doing work i sometimes like to think ahead of the current task and figure out what could happen if i do this or that which helps me realize tasks faster and i can suddenly just feel more creative. So in order to be ready I sometimes think about the steps needed to the task by using my notes app on my computer or phone which has been helped to finish assignments and catch up with school. Since certain tasks limit me from going ahead, I can just figure out what to by doing other tasks or assignments from school to spend my time efficently making my mind feel relaxed and ready. </p>

<h4>Time Management</h4>

<p>During my school week it consists of morning volleyball practice and afternoon training on 3 days of the week. This is on top of my time of my school which like around almost 8 hours each day. As the week progresses I find myself stuck with at least 5 homework assigments each week which really makes me feel behind, to fix this i have decided to use my rest days which are tuesday and thursday to complete the assignments as soon as possible and any other tasks after my training to help my mind relax. Although I find myself doing extra 3 hours on online games cutting down my free time to 1-2 hours. Soon once my volleyball season starts everything will change and my work will be done before the end of the week since there are games frequently on weekends too. On occasion I will need help which can take some time for me to resolve but I can get it finished. Also any school days off will help me relax and spend extra time doing assignments to get some stress out. </p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>while the year continues to pass I look forward to working with more people and make a website informing people of the things effects volleyball has when playing the sport. with my passion of the sport I hope to make a creative project and learn new things to improve the way Volleyball is perceived.</p>
