The Tool I am deciding to use is aframe because of the way you can design objects your choice and make them seem somewhat real just from shapes and some html and css code. While I was changing some things around i decided to try to recreate a volleyball net in the scene since my topic is related to volleyball and making something that the audience would know what my future invention is for makes things easier to explain its purpose. In the actual scene what I did was add some shapes or more specifically cylinders and squares and what happened was the positions, radius, color, height and width was made different so that they would create a realistic scene for my topic. Also I was able to include a floor and some balls to describe the scene better. Below is an image of how that screen looked.

This is a preview of what the code looks like but in a small amount.
```
<a-box position="-8 0.5 -3" rotation="0 10 0" height="5.5" color="#00FFFF"></a-box>
      <a-box position="8 0.5 -3" rotation="0 10 0" height="5.5" color="#00FFFF"></a-box>
      <a-sphere position="0 0.5 10" radius="0.5" color="#FFFFFF"></a-sphere>
      <a-sphere position="3 0.5 10" radius="0.5" color="#FFFFFF"></a-sphere>
      <a-sphere position="0.8 0.5 -10" radius="0.5" color="#FFFFFF"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder
        position="-8 0.5 -3"
        radius="0.8"
        height="1.5"
        color="#808080"
        rotate(90deg)
      ></a-cylinder>
      <a-cylinder
                position="-7 3 -3"
                  rotation="0 0 90"
                  radius="0.05"
      ></a-cylinder>
```
