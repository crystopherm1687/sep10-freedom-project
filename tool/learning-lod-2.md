## Tool: "Aframe"

### 3/17/25

* This type of code can used to move objects in the scene so now there are more chances that the balls can move using raycasting.`<a-entity camera raycaster="objects: .clickable" cursor="fuse: true; maxDistance: 20; fuseTimeout: 1500">
</a-entity>`

*More ideas of moveable objects in scenes could work as some people could visualize balls moving when there is a set being played.`<a-box position="0 1 -5" animation="property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; dur: 2000; loop: true"></a-box>
`

*Try to use these ideas once I use Aframe again.
