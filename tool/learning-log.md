# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **aframe**

### 3/2/25:
* Position, height, width, radius should be changed in objects placed in the scene.
* align the numbers carefully to match their respective places.
* volleyball net succesfully created.
* Work on fixing the ground and way the balls look as well as the outside.
* Start designing my invention to see what it looks like.

### 3/17/25:
* This type of code can used to move objects in the scene so now there are more chances that the balls can move using raycasting.`<a-entity camera raycaster="objects: .clickable" cursor="fuse: true; maxDistance: 20; fuseTimeout: 1500">
</a-entity>`

*More ideas of moveable objects in scenes could work as some people could visualize balls moving when there is a set being played.`<a-box position="0 1 -5" animation="property: rotation; to: 0 360 0; dur: 2000; loop: true"></a-box>
`

*Try to use these ideas once I use Aframe again.
